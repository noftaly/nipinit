## Installation

```shell
$ npm i -g nipinit
```


## Features

- Initialize an NPM project
- Initialize Git & .gitignore
- Create Github's file (templates, changelog, contributing, and if you set a linter, a lint action)
- Set a license (choose between MIT, ISC and GPL-v3)
- Use ES Modules (NodeJS' ES Modules, not Babel's)
- Install & configure Babel
- Install & configure ESLint (choose between my configuration (noftalint), airbnb, recommended and standard)
- Install & configure nodemon, cross-env and concurrently
- Create a README and a .editorconfig
- Save & use presets


## Usage

### Requirements

- You need to have NodeJS v14.8.0 or newer to use nipinit. You can check your nodejs' version with `node -v`

### Fresh start

To start a new NPM project, go to the directory you want in your terminal, and type:
```shell
$ nipinit
```
You will be prompted some questions to generate the boilerplate that fits you the most, and you will be good to go!

### Presets

You can create presets when creating a new project. (answer 'Yes' to the question `Do you want to save this preset?`).
After that, you can generate a new project using this preset just by adding the `--preset preset_name` argument to nipinit. (it has an alias: `-p`)
```shell
$ nipinit --preset myCoolPreset
```

If you create a project without using a prest, but it happens that the exact same preset is already saved, nipinit will tell you so you can use it next time!

You can also manage your presets with
```shell
$ nipinit preset
```
Add the `--help` option to see all available arguments.

- [x] Change the project to TypeScript
- [x] Add a class to manage/query Database
- [x] Change the db type (move from JSON? Just change the lib?) (moved from 'lowdb' to 'conf')
